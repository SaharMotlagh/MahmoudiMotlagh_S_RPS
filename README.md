## Rock Paper Scissors Game with Python!

**Rock paper scissors** (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone", or as Rochambeau, roshambo, or ro-sham-bo) is a **hand game**, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.
<br><br>
 These shapes are **"rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors"** (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.
